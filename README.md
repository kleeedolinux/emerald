This repository exists as a mirror.

The primary and canonical home of Emerald is on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/emerald-lang/emerald).

Development, issues, and decisions happen there.

## Why Codeberg

Emerald was started in 2026, which gave us the opportunity to choose our platform intentionally from the beginning.

We chose **Codeberg first**.

This decision is not about rejecting GitHub itself. We recognize GitHub’s importance and its role in open source history, and many of us, including the maintainer, have been highly active on GitHub for years.

However, GitHub’s current direction is increasingly shaped by Microsoft’s aggressive push toward AI-centric products and workflows. This affects platform priorities, engineering focus, and long-term trust.

We are not anti-AI.  
AI can be a useful tool when it is optional, transparent, and user controlled.

What we do not support is:

- The abuse of AI as a platform strategy
- Forcing AI features into core development workflows
- Treating AI adoption as a requirement rather than a choice
- Reshaping developer infrastructure primarily around AI products

Emerald is a human-written project. We want the surrounding infrastructure to respect that.

## Why This GitHub Repository Exists

GitHub is still where many developers discover projects.

For that reason, this repository exists as a mirror.
This means:

- This repository is not the source of truth
- Issues and pull requests are not accepted here
- The authoritative repository lives on Codeberg

If you want to contribute, report issues, or follow development, please use the Codeberg repository.

## Platform Independence

Open source benefits from infrastructure that is predictable, transparent, and not tightly coupled to a single corporate strategy or national policy direction.

Codeberg is a non-profit platform that aligns with those principles.  
For Emerald, that makes it the right place to build long term.
